* On not using TDD
********************
- Manual 'point and click' tesing while refactoring was time consuming.
- Not confident that my point and click testing was thorough enough.
- Temptation to not conduct manual tests after each change and take bigger steps between testing.
- Didn't think about edge cases in enough detail so had to go back to work on an acceptance test
  that I though was complete after starting on a new acceptance test.
