* On not using TDD
********************
- Manual 'point and click' tesing while refactoring was time consuming.
- Not confident that my point and click testing was thorough enough.
- Temptation to not conduct manual tests after each change and take bigger steps between testing.
- Didn't think about edge cases in enough detail so had to go back to work on an acceptance test
  that I though was complete after starting on a new acceptance test.
- Time between me introducing a bug and noticing it was longer than when I use TDD. 

********************
* Next Steps
********************
- Only allow users to edit inputs that they are allowed to.
  e.g. can't enter anything in the second roll if you get a strike in the first.
- Looking into nesting of directives (may want a frame directive ...)
- Add a leader board that inspects several score card directives.
